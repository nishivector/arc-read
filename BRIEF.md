ONE VERB: INTERCEPT
GAME IN 10 WORDS: Draw arcs where enemies will be; your city survives
WHAT THE PLAYER MASTERS: Leading a moving target — dragging not to where the enemy is but to where it will arrive; calibrating that angle differently for every enemy speed class
THE WOW MOMENT: Wave 5 — enemy ships begin launching homing missiles. Your interceptors can kill those missiles mid-flight. The first time a player draws an arc that detonates a missile in the open sky — not a ship, a bullet — it feels like discovering a new game entirely
WHY RICARDO: R-Type — formations telegraph their intent before acting; the entire skill is committing to a read before they fire. Metal Slug — every arc gives instant visual feedback, threat-reading is visceral and clear, misreads are punished immediately
EMOTIONAL ARC:
  start: You draw to the ship. It misses. You draw further ahead. It hits. The aha lands in under 30 seconds.
  groove: You stop seeing positions and start seeing trajectories — the battlefield becomes a field of moving futures you're solving in real time
  climax: Three simultaneous attack vectors; two are feints; you have one interceptor left and three seconds to read which threat is real
WHAT MAKES IT HARD: Every enemy class moves at a different speed — the lead angle that kills a cruiser overshoots a fighter by half a screen; you calibrate through failure and pattern memory
SKILL CEILING: A 1x player reacts to threats as they close. A 10x player pre-draws intercept arcs the moment a formation enters screen, clears the entire wave before any enemy reaches firing range, and saves interceptors for the missile sub-layer
VISUAL: #7A3060 (deep magenta background), #F0EBD8 (warm off-white city silhouette + HUD), #4DFFD6 (cyan arc trail + detonation flash) — top-down with a 25 degree tilt; Missile Command geometry meets Tron line-art
AUDIO: 92 BPM, slow menacing low-brass drone beneath a sparse high synth, signature sound: a clean thwip-CRACK when an arc connects on a missile mid-air
NOT: no tower placement or upgrade trees, no automatic area-of-effect weapons
GAME NAME HINT: arc-read
